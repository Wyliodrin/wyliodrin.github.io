                    <p>Being the most affordable embedded Linux device and having the largest community, the <b>Raspberry Pi</b> is one of our main supported device. You can connect <b>Arduino</b> or <b>OpenMote</b> controllers to the Raspberry Pi to build and deploy firmware from Wyliodrin STUDIO in order to read various sensors.</p>

				  <h2 class="text-center">Arduino Yun</h2>
                    <p>You might now them only as microcontrollers, but Arduino has several models that run Linux, like the <b>Arduino Yun</b> and the <b>Arduino Tian</b>. We are working closely with Arduino to offer Arduino Linux devices out of the box.</p>
